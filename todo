Main Features:

A couple of UV unwrapping operators, that leave the texture alone.
Maybe with toggles to enable "snap internals verts to pixels" or
only "snap bounds to pixels"
 
 - [x] GRID MAPPING
 - [x] EXTEND UNWRAP
 - [x] UNWRAP TO SINGLE PIXEL 
 - [ ] COPY/PASTE UV

Then one operator to reorganize the UV map, this is dangerous
because actual image pixels will be moved. Another operator
to clean out the palette because direct texture paint
doesn't always paint with full opacity.
 
 - [x] REPACK UVS
 - [ ] PALETTE CLEANUP


Common utilities that are needed:

 - [x] find a free section for UV island

 - [ ] toggle for snap to pixel
 - [ ] copy uv / set to unique
 - [x] fill texture pink

 - [x] "island to free space" must also be able to do "selection (only) to free space"

TESTING REMARKS:

 - [x] need a 'magic' unwrap, that extends triangles if they are included
 - [x] grid map should compute pixel size per column, and then size to that, instead of snapping afterwards
 - [x] preserve overlapping islands when repacking

 - [x] map single pixel would be very useful
 - [x] grid map should deal with multiple "quad islands" and not just bork on that (brute forced it...)
 - [ ] copy paste uv is necessary
 - [ ] flip might be useful for copy paste?
 - [ ] some error when unwrapping grid where a row_sizes entry stays empty


CROCOJAM FINDINGS:

 - [ ] Need a way to pick colors quickly (from palette)
 - [ ] Need a way to set brush size quickly
 - [x] "Selection to Free Space" is super unintuitive currently. It just doesn't seem to work? I'm not sure if 
  it depends on pinned islands or ALL islands (for determining free space). If it's the latter, then
  the plugin might need a button to 'clear all UVs' (basically assigning them to somewhere outside the UV map)
  so that the whole texture becomes free space.
 - [x] Deal with multiple objects (to allow for linked meshes to be painted at the same time). 
 - [ ] Triangles get stuck when using "FOLD X / FOLD Y"


TESTING #3
 - [x] Need a real Rect unwrap (scale only outer coords, don't snap every single UV vert)
 - [x] When doing "Unwrap Grid" with multiple unconnected islands, should just work for each island separately
 - [x] Some buttons to up/downsize texture (and never do it automatically?)
 - [x] Repacking without 'modify texture' ****s everything up if a different size is required. Needs a dialog (and item above)

MORE BUGS
 - [x] Single pixels SHOULD be more than a pixel sized because bleed will spread over neighbors otherwise
 - [x] Move to free space on single pixel mapped islands doesnt work (it splits up the islands?!)
 - [ ] Tool to "Snap Bounds to Pixels" (basically what Unwrap Rect does)
 - [ ] Unwrap Rect is broken sometimes, though

 - [x] Set Blend Mode of newly generated material to Alpha Clip

 - [x] Flipping and rotating is broken (check vegetation file: reed)
 - [x] Selection to free space on multiple islands makes them overlap
 - [x] Doubling texture size is broken and results in some weird scaling of the UV islands
 - [x] Button to move island to random position inside texture? Useful for material textures.

 - [x] Dim the colors of the default texture to better see seams when unwrapping
 - [ ] When multiple objects are in the scene with same texture, repack should work on all of them
 - [x] Repack is broken when modifying texture? I'm getting some "copy_region_from" does not exist. 

 - [ ] flip operators should also require texture save
 - [x] flip operator on overlapping islands does really weird stuff
 - [ ] flip/rotate on multiple islands is probably still broken

 - [ ] Blender crashes when: Doubling a texture size, then attempting to "Unwrap Grid"
 - [ ] "Island to Free Space" does not preserve texture?

 - [ ] Fold should either bring triangles along, or refuse when triangles are selected. Not leave them behind silently

 - [x] Single Pixel Unwrap is broken? Makes the island a tad too big? Should be smaller than 1px
 - [x] Move "CREATE TEXTURE" button up and make bigger
 - [ ] Create button to toggle "Snap to pixel corners" on UV
 - [x] Info button that shows texture usage. My texture is "full" but I don't see why!
